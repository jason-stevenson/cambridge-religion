                        <p>The liturgy is a continuing celebration of God’s ongoing presence in the world. The Second Vatican Council described the liturgy as ‘source and summit’ of Christian life. It is a pattern of initiative and response: God’s initiative and the Christian person’s response, which underlies all of the Christian life. The pattern of initiative and response is clearly evidenced in liturgy. God’s outreach is expressed in the readings from the Bible and the gift of God comes to the community through the sacraments. People respond to both reading and sacrament.</p>

                        <p>Liturgy has several defining characteristics:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Liturgy is the public and official worship of the church; it is not just the Mass and the sacrament.</li>
                            <li>God’s outreach is expressed.</li>
                            <li>Lod comes to the community through the sacraments. People respond to both reading and sacrament.</li>
                        </ul>
                </div>
